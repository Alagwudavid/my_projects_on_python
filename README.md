## Getting-Started:
1. Clone this repository or download the zip file.
2. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the script: ```python [filename].py```
4. You can now analyze my python files.

## Simple-Calculator
- this is a simple python calculator that calculates using the mathematical expressions ```i.e: +, - , *, %``` for a one-time solving.
  - code below:
    ```
    def calculator():
      num1, sign, num2 = input("clc: ").split()
      num1 = int(num1)
      num2 = int(num2)
      if sign == "*":
      ...
        ### view file to view full version
      ...
      else:
          print("Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, /, or %.")
    calculator()```

# Class method
```
Class Name:
    static_variable = "comes before a method def __init__(self, arg=value)"

def main():
    Name.static_variable //to access the static variable in your methods
main()
```
# Constant Variables on python
Fixed or Constant variables can be achieved and accessed in the program by typing variable name in uppercase and cannot be changed later in the program except from the main variable itself
```
EXAMPLE_CONSTANT = 20
```
# Lists
```
creating a list:
using "variable_name = []"
```

# Dictionary items
```
symbols = {"A": 2, "B":4, "C":6, "D":8}

for symbol, symbol_count in symbols.items():
```

# Notice
this projects are my beginner projects on my self taught python language learning journey, if there is any way the codes in any way you debug and identify a bug you can contact or request to correct the codes to improve my learning journey.
