## Simple-Calculator
- this is a simple python calculator that calculates using the mathematical expressions ```i.e: +, - , *, %``` for a one-time solving.
  - code below:
    ```
    def calculator():
      num1, sign, num2 = input("clc: ").split()
      num1 = int(num1)
      num2 = int(num2)
      if sign == "*":
      ...
        ### view file to view full version
      ...
      else:
          print("Invalid operator. Please use +, -, *, /, or %.")
    calculator()```
